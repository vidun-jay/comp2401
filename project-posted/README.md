## Compilation and Launching
To compile and run the program, `cd` into the working directory and run:

```make all && ./final```

This will both compile and run the program.

## Operation Instructions
Simply enter the names of the four hunters and the program should simulate the four hunters chasing a ghost to the terminal. Each hunter collects a single type of evidence and each ghost can be one of four different types. A ghost can do nothing, move to connected rooms, and leave ghostly evidence in a room. A hunter can share their evidence with our hunters, move rooms, and collect evidence. If either the hunter or the ghost get bored from being in a room, they will leave and go to a different one. A hunter will also leave if their fear gets too high.
